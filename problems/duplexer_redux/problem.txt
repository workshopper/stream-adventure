In this example, you will be given a readable stream, `counter`, as the first
argument to your exported function:

    module.exports = function (counter) {
        // return a duplex stream to count countries on the writable side
        // and pass through `counter` on the readable side
    };

Return a duplex stream with the `counter` as the readable side. You will be
written objects with a 2-character `country` field as input, such as these:
 
    {"short":"OH","name":"Ohio","country":"US"}
    {"name":"West Lothian","country":"GB","region":"Scotland"}
    {"short":"NSW","name":"New South Wales","country":"AU"}

Create an object to track the number of occurrences of each unique country code.

For example:

    {"US": 2, "GB": 3, "CN": 1}

Once the input ends, call `counter.setCounts()` with your counts object.

The `duplexer2` module will again be very handy in this example.

If you use duplexer, make sure to `npm install duplexer2` in the directory where
your solution file is located.
